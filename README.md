I have found that as time goes on in this class, my estimates get less accurate, because the requirements of the assignments are more nebulous. There is no clear stopping point, so I can always find something else to work on.  My estimates get most thrown off by testing.  In this assignment, I spent two of my five hours just trying to get tests to pass. There were no bugs in the program, and everything worked on the server, but I had to manipulate how the tests were written to get them to pass. I believe that this will take much less of my time in the future as I get more used to test syntax and how they work.
